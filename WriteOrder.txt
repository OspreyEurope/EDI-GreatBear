Orders are written in 2 sections.
The file location that the order is written to is:
- "C:\\Bespoke\\EDI\\OutputFiles\\" + row["OrderNumber"].ToString() + ".txt";
- Line 359 File EDIWRite.cs
- row["OrderNumber"].ToString() is the OrderNumber as many orders may be in the database ready to be sent.

In order to write an order, you need to do run the following:
- EDIWrite.WriteOrder(conKTN);

This will then do 2 seperate sections of code.
The inital is as follows:
- Using SP "OSP_Write_Header_EDI" from DB "Ordbis_Interface" server "TH_DEVSQL01",
- This SP will gather all of the relevant information for an order, this will include
	- Locations,
	- Dates,
	- Contact Details,
- This information does not need to be repeated hence is written as a header segment.

The next section to this file write is as follows:
- WriteProductsKTN(con, streamWriter, row["OrderNumber"].ToString(), counter);
	- The OrderNumber is required as this is what links each item to the relevant Order Header details,
- This function querys the "Orders_To_KTN_Lines" table in the DB to retried the relevant order line information,
- This continues to write the items for the order file before returning to the previous function for the footer.

Changes to be made when made live include an update function.
This is written on line 477 and jsut needs uncommenting,
This function runs the update query from sahredfunctions to udpate the flag on the orders header table,
This indiciates if the order has been processed or not.
SP can is called "OSP_Update_StatusID_KTN_Orders" and found in "Orbis_Interface".
This takes the order ID as the value to udpate
