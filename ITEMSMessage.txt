Product lists are writted as a WareHouseID_Product_List.txt file to the output files location.
This location is currently localy hosted so will need to be redirected to a new file location:
- "C:\\Bespoke\\EDI\\OutputFiles\\" + id + "_Product_List.txt";
- Line 595 in EDIWrite.cs

In the Program, all that needs to be passed to write a product list for a product list message is as follows:
- EDIWrite.WriteProductList(conLive, WarehouseID);
- The WarehouseID is the numeric ID value

Ths will then auto run the query that fetches all the order information from the relevant tables (Laid out below).
From here all the products are written line by line with the relevant information.

The stored procedures that are used in this are:
- "OSP_GET_PRODUCT_LIST"
	- "OERA", "TH-SQLE1901"
		- dbo.StockItems, dbo.PRODUCT_MASTER_STOCK, dbo.PRODUCT_MASTER

The files and functions that are used in producing this file are:
- "EDIWrite.cs", "WriteProductList",
- "SharedFunctions.cs", "QueryDB",
