ASN are writted as a POXXXXXX.txt file to the output files location.
This location is currently localy hosted so will need to be redirected to a new file location:
- "C:\\Bespoke\\EDI\\OutputFiles\\PO" + id + ".txt" 
- Line 494 in EDIWrite.cs

In the program, all that needs to be passed in order to write an ASN message is the following:
- EDIWrite.WriteASNFile(conDev, X);
- The value of X is the value of the Order Number from table "PurchaseOrdersToKTN" in DB "TH-DEVSQL01"

Ths will then auto run the query that fetches all the order information from "PurchaseOrdersToKTN".
It then writes the header style data once and cycles through he item based data as required if an order has more than 1 line to it.

The stored procedures that are used in this are:
- "OSP_GET_PO_DATA"
	- "Orbis_Interface", "TH-DEVSQL01"

The files and functions that are used in producing this file are:
- "EDIWrite.cs", "WriteASNFile",
- "SharedFunctions.cs", "QueryDB",
